# Ender5_Voron_Legacy_conversion

!!!! only did a test fit the printer is not working yet !!!!

Adjusted stl's for a ender 5 to voron legacy conversion.

These STL's mainly make the voron lagacy parts work better with V slot extrusions.
The bed mount's have been adjusted to fit the Ender 5 bed (be mindfull of the solderd cables they need propper strain relief. i still need to make that)

The new parts are minor modifications from the original parts that can be found on the github page
